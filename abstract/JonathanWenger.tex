\abstract{
\emph{Probabilistic numerical methods} (PNMs) \cite{Hennig2015a, Oates2019,Cockayne2019a} aim to explicitly represent uncertainty resulting from limited computational resources and stochastic input in numerical computation. This emerging paradigm treats a numerical problem as one of statistical inference instead. It holds the promise to improve upon classic methods in areas where adaptivity is needed, related problems are solved repeatedly, stochasticity plays a role and solutions are not unique. However, one key barrier to the wider adoption of such methods is the lack of probabilistic numerics software. 

In this talk, we demonstrate how the theoretical formulation of PNMs can be translated into an algorithmic framework and introduce \textsc{ProbNum} -- a software stack for probabilistic numerics.
It enables the composition of problem-specific PNMs and paves the way for consistent propagation of uncertainty through the entirety of a computational pipeline.
